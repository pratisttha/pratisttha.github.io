            Technology, as we all know is developing more with time becoming more available to more people around the world. 
             Each new generation gets more exposed to it  earlier than their prior generation. <br>
             Technology has inevitably become such an integrated part of our society and life that it is hard to think of a life without the technology we have now. 
             And with how omnipresent it is, the obvious question arises- Is it good or bad, or neutral? 
             But maybe rather than it being good or bad, it is more about its importance and usage. 
             We can think of the endless negative impact technology could have but the absence of the technology would be worse than any of its negative impact.<br>
             Like every man-made thing, it’s is not bad, it’s neither good. 
             Technology has no moral stance, it all depends on how it is being used. 
             It is very important to regulate the availability and usage. 
             The intention of making technology is obviously to make our life easier and have a positive impact. 
             And it has made great impacts that have helped people, especially in the medical field. 
             The Healthcare industry has developed and has been able to provide patients with the best diagnostic tools, treatment services, and procedures that require minimal pain and incision.
             Even in medicine making, technology has played a big role in making the most effective and quick healing medicines. <br>

            In these times of pandemic and lockdown, technology has played a big role in helping people get by. 
            Because people are forced to stay indoors and isolated, organizations have no choice but to progress online.
             And thanks to technological advances almost everything can be done online now, because of which the number of unemployed people is lesser than what could have been. 
             For students or people in the educational sector, technology is very important. We can’t go to school during a pandemic but our studies have not paused. 
             Our courses are moving forward through online classes and we are doing our exams and assignments online. 
             Online school is the biggest impact of technology in my life and I am sure it is the case for most of the students. 
             Not just during the pandemic, being able to go online and research about the study materials have always been a part of our studies. <br>
             Technology is a part of our lives. 
             We are very much dependent on it, and maybe that is its biggest impact. 
             Our dependence leads to more development and production of technology.<br> 
             Thus, we should be more thoughtful as to how our consumption affects ourselves and the environment around us and use it for the betterment of all.
